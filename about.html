      <h1>Notice to BIL Users: The Brain Image Library will be undergoing maintenance from 10/16 until 10/17. Please halt uploads until the maintenance is complete.</h1>
<p>
The <b>Brain Image Library (BIL)</b> is a national public resource enabling researchers to deposit, analyze, mine, share and interact with large brain image datasets. BIL encompasses the deposition of datasets, the integration of datasets into a searchable web-accessible system, the redistribution of datasets, and a computational enclave to allow researchers to process datasets in-place and share restricted and pre-release datasets.
</p>
<p>
BIL serves a geographically distributed customer base including large confocal imaging centers that are generating petabytes of confocal imaging datasets per year. For these customers, the library serves as an archive facility for whole brain volumetric datasets from mammals. BIL also serves geographically distributed researchers who want to interact with and download library datasets.
</p>
<p>
The BIL is operated as a partnership between the Biomedical Applications Group at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, the Center for Biological Imaging at the University of Pittsburgh and the Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center at Carnegie Mellon University.

The mission of the Center for Biologic Imaging is to provide integrated elite level access and training on infrastructure used for research, education, technology development and collaboration in Microscopy, Biophotonics and Imaging. The Center is deeply committed to providing open and transparent access to the most cutting edge optical imaging equipment to all biomedical research faculty, though with priority where access is intended to lead to funded collaborations or where funded collaborations pre-exist and joint outputs such as co-authored publications, IP filings and grant applications will result.
