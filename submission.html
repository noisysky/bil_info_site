<H1>Data Submission</H1>
	    
<h2 id="Overview" data-id="Overview" style=""><span>Overview</span></h2><p><span>The data submission portal enables laboratories to submit data to the Brain Image Library. The key processes to submit data are:</span></p><ol>
<li><span>Create an account.</span></li>
<li><span>Log in to the data submission portal.</span></li>
<li><span>Create a submission: A submission is a collections of image sets associated with the metadata.</span></li>
<li><span>Upload image data: Because this is the time-limiting step, we suggest this step be started before uploading metadata for the submission collection.</span></li>
<li><span>Upload metadata: Submission collection metadata can be uploaded through the portal in spreadsheet format.</span></li>
<li><span>Validate data: Users request to validate the data and correct any errors discovered.</span></li>
<li><span>Data is made public: Once data is validated and metadata is curated, the submission is made public.</span></li>
</ol><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2fCzGEQ.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000"></p><h4 id="Definitions" data-id="Definitions"><strong><span>Definitions</span></strong></h4><p><span>The following terms in this document have specific context, as defined below:</span></p><p><strong><span>Dataset</span></strong><br>
<span>At BIL a dataset is a stand-alone entry of an image-volume or image-set associated with a single subject or experimental unit with unique metadata. A single dataset is usually associated with a single donor or subject when submitting multiple subjects in a collection, or a single part of the brain when imaging many parts of the brain in a collection. Many datasets make up a collection. A dataset typically contains many 2d image files that are assembled to form a more complex two or three dimensional volume.</span></p><p><strong><span>Submission</span></strong><br>
<span>A submission contains one or more related datasets and the associated metadata. Submissions will inherit project metadata (such as the NIH project, grant number, laboratory name, etc.), thus all datasets within a submission must belong to the same project. A submission can contain a single or multiple datasets. In general, smaller submissions are recommended because all datasets within a submission must pass the validation process for the datasets within the submission to be published. Each “level” of data should be uploaded in separate submissions (e.g. The set of raw data and the same data aligned to a reference are considered two separate submissions).</span></p><p><strong><span>Project</span></strong><br>
<span>A way of grouping data to ensure that (1) People working with the data get gain appropriate access and credit for their contributions and (2) Data is linked to the proper funding sources.</span></p><p><strong><span>Publish</span></strong><br>
<span>The act of making a submission that has passed all validation checks publicly available.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span>Each dataset was generated from a single sample and donor (e.g. whole brain imaging) on the same instrument. Multiple datasets can be accommodated in a single submission. The lines of the specimen tab in the metadata spreadsheet must match exactly to the lines in the dataset tab (i.e. the specimen listed in specimen tab row 5 is the specimen for dataset row 5). Each dataset tab should have a corresponding image tab. There should be exactly one line in the instrument tab.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The dataset was generated from multiple samples, specimens, or donors on the same instrument. Only a single dataset can be accommodated per submission. Multiple specimens should be listed in the metadata spreadsheet, but only a single dataset. There should be one line in the image tab. There should be exactly one line in the instrument tab.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>All datasets were generated from one specimen, but are from unique regions of interest on the specimen. Multiple datasets can be accommodated in a single submission. List the specimen multiple times in the specimen tab. Identify the specific region of interest in the locations column. Multiple donor lines must match exactly in the metadata spreadsheet (i.e. the specimen listed in specimen tab row 5 is the specimen for dataset row 5). Each dataset tab should have a corresponding image tab. There should be exactly one line in the instrument tab.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>All datasets were generated from one specimen – but use different experimental (machinery) parameters. Multiple datasets can be accommodated as a single submission. There should be exactly one entry in the specimen tab. The lines listed in the Instrument tab in the metadata spreadsheet must match exactly to the lines in the dataset tab (i.e. the instrument listed in instrument tab row 5 is the instrument for dataset row 5). Each dataset tab should have a corresponding image tab.</span></p>
</li>
</ol><p><span>After a metadata spreadsheet is prepared, select the submission collection it will be associated with. Then select the </span><code>Upload Metadata</code><span> button to select your metadata spreadsheet and upload it. This button will not be available until a metadata schema is selected.</span></p><p><span>Note that while preparing the metadata spreadsheet, separate data directories need to be listed for each dataset in the submission.</span></p><h3 id="5-Upload-image-data" data-id="5-Upload-image-data" style=""><span>5. Upload image data</span></h3><p><span>The submission portal creates an upload landing zone space for you to transfer your image data to. To find this landing zone, select the Submissions sub-option of the View menu. The field “Data Path” shows the landing zone space for the submission.</span></p><p><span>The ingestion process currently supports native TIFF formats and are validated using the bioformats tool.

<h2>Additional Submission Information</h2>

<p><b>Image File Formats</b></p>

<p>
The ingestion process supports native TIFF file format and are validated using the 
bioformats tool. (For more information on the bioformats tool see: 
<a href="https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.7.3/formats/index.html">
https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.7.3/formats/index.html</a>.)
</p> 
<p><b>Metadata Formats and Schema</b></p>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://submit.brainimagelibrary.org/">Submission 
Portal</a> for the most recent metadata specification.
</p>
<p>The archive is transitioning to a new, more comprehensive metadata schema developed as a part of the NIH BRAIN Initiative "BRAIN 3D MICROSCOPY STANDARDS PROJECT". For more information about the standards project, please see the <a 
href="https://www.doryworkspace.org/">Dory website</a>.   A draft spreadsheet implementing this standard, which will soon be required by the ingest portal is available here. Collecting metadata on this more extensive form will also enable BIL to issue DOIs for datasets when data is submitted. 
<p>
<p><b>Sharing and computing on data prior to submission:</b></p><p>
<p>
All data submitters are given access to a login node "login.brainimagelibrary.org". 
	To connect to this node, use a terminal program that implements ssh (such as 
	xterm, the native mac terminal program, or PuTTY) and use the same username 
	and password that you would use for the submission portal. The login node is
	ideal for non-cpu intensive processing, such as editing or deleting a file 
	that is already in the landing zone. The login node is not intended for heavy 
	computation or visualization, but it is connected to the BIL Computational 
	Cluster. The BIL computational cluster provides a suitable resource for both
	computation and visualization. in addition, if you need to perform more intensive
	processing on your data, please see this 
	<a href="https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/computevisual.html">computing and 
	visualization page</a> or contact the <a href="contact.html">BIL Helpdesk</a> for further assistance.
</p>
<!--
<p>By default, the files in the landing zone will only be accessible by you 
and BIL support staff. You can, of course, change the permissions on the 
landing zone to be group or world readable with chmod. This may help if you 
need to share the data with others (such as other lab group members) before 
completing the submission process. 
</p>
-->

<p><b>Assistance and Help</b></p>
<p>If you need assistance with anything, 
please contact the <a href="contact.html">BIL Helpdesk</a> for assistance.
Please note that we are located in the Eastern Time zone. </p> 
<p>
Please note that BIL also provides networking support. If you are 
experiencing networking issues related to data transfer (including 
slow transfer speeds), contact the <a href="contact.html">BIL Helpdesk</a>.
If network issues prevent data transfer, we may recommend that you send 
your datasets to us via an alternate path such on our BrainBall portable 
device or on LTO tape.  
</p>
<p><b>Distribution Licence</b></p>
Data contributed to the library will be redistributed to others under a 
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. In 
addition, all data submitters expressly permit the Library data to be 
transferred to and maintained by another open data repository or by 
a government agency such as the US National Institutes of Health.
</p>
<p>
<b>Release of entries</b></p>
<p>
Data submitted to the library, by default,  will be released as soon 
as possible once data has completed the submission process. Optionally, 
data submitters can select a limited embargo period for their submitted 
data consistant with the data sharing policies of the BRAIN initiative and 
NIH data sharing policies, or up to one year if the data was not NIH funded. 
</p>
<p><b>Assignment of DOI</b></p>
BIL will soon issue permanent, citable DOI for submitted datasets, when the new metadata schema is implemented. BIL can also issue DOI's for groups of data so that they may be cited in a paper (<a href="https://doi.brainimagelibrary.org/doi/10.35077/g.19">See here for an example</a>).  
</p>
<p><b>Changes to entries after submission</b></p><p>
Changes may be made to submitted entries prior to release. Minor changes, 
such as updating metadata or adding citations may be made after dataset 
release. Major revisions will require the existing entry to be marked as 
obsolete and replaced by a new entry. The DOI pointing to the metadata for 
the obsolete entry may have a superseded-by field added to it to point
users to the superceded entry. There may be also be circumstances in which 
an entry in the library may be marked as withdrawn (for example, research 
misconduct). In those cases, the DOI for the obsolete entry will have a  
withdrawn field added to it.  
</p>
</p>
<p><b>Use of Pre-publication Data</b></p><p>
The Library expects all users of the submitted data, unless explicitly granted by the data submitter or the data submitter's project, 
	to grant the authors of the data the right to publish the first paper concerning the dataset within three years of deposit. 
	If there is no publication associated with the dataset, please contact the listed authors for permission to publish. 
	There is no restriction on post-publication data.
